## Portal to the Universe

This is clone of the 'Portal to the Universe' app for iPhone
http://www.portaltotheuniverse.org/

The original application has been designed and developed by VÃ­ctor R. Ruiz (@vrruiz, linotipo.es), with contributions from Lars Holm Nielsen (ESO).

You can find the original source code here:

The application reads RSS feeds from the portaltotheuniverse.org site. It stores the posts' summaries on the device, for offline reading. The feeds are: 

    featured news, which highlight stories from news sites 
    featured blog posts
    selected posts from the astronomy blogosphere
    and featured podcasts 
    
Finally, the search feature uses the Google Custom Search Engine API.
